In this project, weâ€™ll practice the use of strings, arrays and pointers.

Task 0 - Write a function that concatenates two strings. It appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte.

Task 1 - concatenates two strings. It will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Task 2 - work exactly like strncpy

Task 3 - compares two strings.

Task 4 - reverses the content of an array of integers.

Task 5 - changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

Task 6 - capitalizes all words of a string.

Task 7 - encodes a string into 1337.

Task 8 - encodes a string using rot13.

ADVANCED

Task 9 - prints an integer without using arrays or pointers

Task 10 - prints a[2] = 98

Task 11 - adds two numbers.

Task 12 - prints a buffer.
