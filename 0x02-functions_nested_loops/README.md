In this project, we'll learn
What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
What are header files and how to to use them with #include
we'll create our own library and will only be allowed to use _putchar

We'll write programs that perform the following tasks:
Task 0 - prints Holberton, followed by a new line.
Task 1 - prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Task 2 - prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Task 3 - checks for lowercase character.
Task 4 - checks for alphabetic character.
Task 5 - prints the sign of a number.
Task 6 - computes the absolute value of an integer.
Task 7 - prints the last digit of a number.
Task 8 - prints every minute of the day, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
Task 9 - prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
Task 10 - adds two integers and returns the result.
Task 11 - prints all natural numbers from n to 98

Advanced
Task 12 - prints the n times table, starting with 0.
Task 13 - computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
Task 14 - prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
Task 15 - finds and sums the even Fibonacci numbers below 4.000.000
Task 16 - finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers
